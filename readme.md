# THREE JS Product Configurator

# Getting Started
Just download the code and run the project on your browser, no need to install any dependencies, everything is included in the source code. You would need to run the code on a local server because of cross origin issues, more on this [here](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/How-to-run-things-locally). VS Code Live Extension will also work.

# Using A Different Model
To use a different model, just add the PATH to your .glb file in the MODEL_PATH constant defined in the script.js file.
